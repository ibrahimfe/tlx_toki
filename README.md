# TLX_TOKI Repository

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from [TLX](https://tlx.toki.id/problems). TLX is an online platform that provides programming challenges and contests to improve coding skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem's ID or title.
- Inside each directory, you will find:
  - The problem statement or a brief description of the problem.
  - My solution code in the appropriate programming language.
  - Additional files or resources if necessary.

## Problem Solving Approach

I approach problem-solving systematically, following these steps:

1. Understanding the problem: I carefully read and analyze the problem statement to understand the requirements and constraints.
2. Designing an algorithm: I devise a plan or algorithm to solve the problem efficiently.
3. Implementing the solution: I translate the algorithm into actual code, making sure to use proper coding conventions and naming conventions.
4. Testing and debugging: I test the solution with various test cases, including both the provided sample cases and additional test cases. I also debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.
5. Optimizing the solution: If necessary, I optimize the code to improve its efficiency or reduce its time and space complexity.

## Contributions

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback or suggestions. If you have any improvements or alternative solutions to the problems, I welcome your contributions. You can fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are my own work and may not always be the most optimal or best solutions. They represent my understanding and approach to the problems at the time of solving them.
